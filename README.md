🚀 Data Science Hackathon: Salary Prediction Model

📌 Overview: This project aims to build a predictive model for estimating the expected salary of engineering graduates based on key features like GPA, number of internships, and number of projects. The model is trained using a synthetic dataset and evaluated for accuracy using the R-squared score.

🔍 Key Features:
Synthetic Dataset: Created with 1000 samples to simulate real-world data.

Feature Selection: Includes GPA, number of internships, and number of projects.

Machine Learning Model: Implements a regression model to predict salaries.

Performance Evaluation: Uses R-squared and other metrics to assess accuracy.

Scalability: Can be adapted to real-world datasets for better insights.

📊 Dataset Description:The dataset contains the following features:
Feature
Description

GPA"Grade Point Average (out of 10)

Internships: Number of internships completed

Projects: Number of academic/industrial projects completed

Salary: Randomly generated salary (in USD)

🛠️ Implementation Steps

Data Preparation: Load and preprocess the dataset.

Data Splitting: Divide the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

Feature Scaling: Normalize data for better model performance.

Model Training: Use linear regression to learn salary patterns.

Model Evaluation: Compute R-squared, MSE, and MAE to measure accuracy.

Salary Prediction: Use the trained model to predict salaries for new graduates.

📈 Model Performance

The model is evaluated using:

R-Squared Score: Measures how well the model explains variability.

Mean Squared Error (MSE): Captures prediction errors.

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures average absolute errors.

🖥️ How to Run the Project:
Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries.

pip install -r requirements.txt

Running the Model

Execute the script to train and test the model:

python salary_model.py

Or use the Jupyter Notebook for step-by-step execution.

jupyter notebook salary_prediction.ipynb

📢 Future Enhancements:
Incorporate real-world salary data for better accuracy.

Experiment with advanced ML models like Random Forest or Neural Networks.

Feature engineering to add more predictive attributes.
